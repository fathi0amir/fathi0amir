- 👋 Hi, I’m @fathi0amir or more correctly it's the other way around! I am Amir Fathi. 
- 👀 I’m interested in good research work mostly building necessary scientific tools in laser scanning microscopy field. 
- 🌱 I’m currently a postdoc in Academia Sinica (Taiwan) working on behaviour studies on zebrafish.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on optimizing my labview microscopy software if anyone interested. It's a mess to start with. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... mmmmmm ... burn a midsize feather of a purple raven on top of the highest spot in your neighborhood. 


P.S. I just loved this page was presented to me so I just went ahead and kept its style.
